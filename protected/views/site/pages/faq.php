            On SPOB most of our jobs do not require a full resume - as part of

                you apply for a job. Your Visual CV is a summary of your key information
            that will assist employers make an easy decision on your suitability,
            in turn decreasing the amount of time it takes for you to find out if you 
                are successful in your application! We will pull some of the information 
                    for your Visual CV from Facebook (your name, about you, education,
                    work experience) but dont worry - you will be able to edit it before we
                send it to an employer'); ?>
